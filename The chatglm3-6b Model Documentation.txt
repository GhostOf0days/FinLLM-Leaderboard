The chatglm3-6b model showed varying performance across multiple categories of financial tasks in the Open Financial Language Leaderboard benchmark. It struggles with Information Extraction (IE) tasks such as NER, FINER-ORD, and FinRED, where Entity F1 scores and general F1 metrics are often near zero. Within the textual analysis tests, chatglm3-6b achieves moderate F1 and Accuracy scores, indicating some capability in interpreting financial sentiment or categorizing content. However, Question Answering tasks like FinQA and TATQA shows low accuracy with numerical reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. While some tasks produce moderate results (e.g., SC, MA), others show missing data or errors (TSA). Chatglm3-6b demonstrates potential in specific areas, but it requires further fine-tuning to handle more domain-specialized financial tasks effectively.
